# QRious

Anonymously and reliably trace your exposure to COVID-19 with secured privacy with blockchain.

# Stop the spread of COVID-19 with privacy


# How QRious is different

1. No tedious writing visit logs or suspicious real time bluetooth/GPS tracking. QRious does not use Bluetooth and GPS technology without a user's agreement. QRious only tracks places where a user visited with an anonymous identifier with scanning QR code.

2. Exposures are put in a blockchain so that it prevents fake news and gives clear, resilient, trustable, and effective anonymous information to the health care officials from its resilient system kept by community.

3. Identifiers are kept forever in your hand. There is no single server keeping your personal information unless user agrees. Privacy is kept default and your personal information and identifier is kept in your device safely.


# How QRious works

1. User downloads an app and creates an identifier to record visited location anonymously.

2. Once identifier is registered in the blockchain, user can visit place and scan QR code to record attendance to the visited place on the blockchain

3. After scanning the QR code of your visited place, a user can check how many anonymous visitors have been there, or a user can get incentives after scanning the qr code of the visited place.
